    <p>I like you so much. You know I collect your name from daily attendance sheet and  send you fb friend request. I went 2 days to your desk earlier when you worked in backend. But I only talked with Veda. I have some resistance when there is girl. But among man I am the manly man. I can present myself. And those resistance slowly slowly can be eradicated. I love vasanth Sir, SVK sir, Ranjith Bro, Ibhubs. Despite having those people in mind I am writing this to you because I want to listen to my heart. I never thought we will worked in same team. When I first worked with you I leave my desk and worked inside room since all things come up in my head. I feel always great around you. Prob is I can't express myself. I love you so much. I believe No one can be as in love with you as I am. What should I going to do about it. I want to listen from you.</p>
