  <div class="content">
    <p>Few days in Medchal I used stay stair (between 1st floor and second floor) before 9am. To see @morning. My memory loves you. I never forget the moment I realized I loved you. </p>
    <p>Before going to FD last time you came from home/college after long days. Suddenly you show after launch. You might wear a olive color dress(i didn’t see you wear that again). You sit middle cabin in first floor. That day I go to interns room(the room straight ahead first floor door) minimum 5 times every hour. I believe you are my soulmate. I feel a strong connection with you which I never experienced before. Feel like you are the closest human being. I will love you till my last breath.</p>
