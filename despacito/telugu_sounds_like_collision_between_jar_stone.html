    <p>You know glass jar? if you keep some stone inside glass jar and shake that jar you will get some sound. Sound from collision between glass jar wall and stone. Earlier when I listened to people conversation in telegu, in front of me I get that sound. always. But when I start listening telegu word from your mouth sound became changed. Every single telegu word drop from your mouth was so soothing to listen, every telegu word was sweetest. When you talk to ranjith bro I try to listen, I try to listen with love. I wish i could hear from your mouth every single day in my life. You are amazing. You are the finest thing on earth. I love you.</p>
    <p>Some days one girl work with us in 77. She had cold. She did sneezing some time in front of us. You know I felt awkward. Few days later you also did some sneezing. I never felt awkward. I feel like when you do sneezing you look so cool that time. It kind of cute sneezing. You are my baby. You know in your sneezing time i used to see you because you will never notice that time. I used to see you whole time in Ranjith bro monitor base. Its working like mirror. I used to see your ornament which you wear in your ear. You look so cool with your ear ornament.  Rekha my memory loves you. I love you so much. You are the cutest girl with very good personality in my life.</p>
    <p>You got the beauty with brain.  Your current hangout status "Let me be me. If u changed me, u will miss me in me" blow over my head. I didn't get that. My hangout status is "I love you Rekha". Its simple sentence written with lot of love.</p>
    <p>You know your name is the most sweetest word to me. Whenever I remember you, you fill my heart. I feel eternal happiness. You are my heaven on earth. I love you babe. You are my goddess. I love you so much. There are nothing in between you and me but I always scared to loose you. I am very afraid to loose you. You are out of my league. You deserve better. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't come back to India. I am about 1800km away from you, but feel like you are the closest human being of mine. Your eyes always attract me. Whenever I see your eyes nenu thappipayaanu. Your smile enchanted me. Every single word from your mouth so sweet to me. I wish I will listen from you every single day in my life. You are my soul mate. You touched my soul. You captured my whole heart. Now i belongs to you. I love you so much dear rekha. You are my sweetheart. I wish I will pamper you every single day in my life. I love you so much. You are the love of my life.</p>
    <p>I read a fictional book The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. Here i found a quote which is very promising  "When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it." I believe it is only you who can understand me hence I submission myself to you completely.</p>
    <p>good night angel ⏰</p>
    <p>You are living inside my heart. I love You. Rekha jee I love you so much.</p>
