    <p>You are amazing. You are angel. Whenever i think i will lose you even though there nothing between u & me, my whole world became cloudy, dark. I can't think this "thinking". I love you so much. I love you so much. I love you more than me. I never thought i will fall in love in life. However i fell and its killing me internally every bit of time. How can i convinced? I love you so much cutie</p>
    <p>I am remembering you morning evening night all time. You became my supreme goddess. I love you so much.</p>
