    <p>“I’m not right person to u”. <br>
     You are pretty right. I am not perfect. You are totally out of my league. Only one thing I can do I can love you with all of my heart,  with all my soul.</p>
     <p>
      "Plz get over it. Just think over it..." <br>
       From December whenever I feel I will miss a angel from my life I feel bad, very bad, feel abnormal. I love you so much. I Love u precious piece of my heart. My first thought in the morning is always you. if you read my mind you would know how much I love you. Now I believe removing You from my heart is impossible for me. I tried. More I tried more I fall for you everyday. Fall in love with your personality. Fall in love with your wisdom. Fall in love with your Eyes.

      "If something went wrong we can't face each other, anyways we have to work together" <br>
       If I go to India pappu will be always in control. This is because if anything know by company or sir about this they will kick me from Bangalore I will drop in Dhaka. I heard sir is very strict about that. I want to live in India my whole life. When I was in Bangalore I logged in and logged out inside room or washroom. <br>
       I feel, in future if any good ending happen in between you and me I won't be able to provide you family. As Indian girl you might dream about it. Rather than getting a guardian You have to be a guardian. Its kind of being a son of your father. So I don't have hope on you. Might be little expectation. I feel like you are very wise girl you can manage all difficulties. You were first girl in you High school. You know I was first boy in my class in High school. I will be OK always. I believe you are the most beautiful things I can keep inside my heart in my whole life. You are my angel.
