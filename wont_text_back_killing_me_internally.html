    <p> Girl, you know I want your love. when you won't text back it's confusing, frustrating more importantly its hurting so much that I can't concentrate on anything. Feeling good when i see you on online, feeling great when you text back. I remembering you whole day. But when i say "i love you so much" it gives  me huge happiness. Whether you text back or not. So i am planning rather than greet i will say "i love you" periodically. Which will save you 10sec typing. I feel like you don't even like me you just condolence me as coworkers not other than that. Whether you serious thug girl or donut heart girl. Things is everyone love their father. But people move on. But rekha jee i love you so much whether you hate me or like me or love me. You never get a man like me who will love you like me. I can never run out of love. The more I love you, the more love I have. Now a days i feel empty. I hope you will never feel these. Its hurting and bad feeling. I love you so much madam. You are d queen. I love you so much. I will love you in my whole life whether you are in distance or very next me. You are my secret holder. I love you so so much. Good day my angel </p>
